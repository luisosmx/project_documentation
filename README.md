    > **NOTE**  
    If you select the "GitHub Enterprise" option when logging in, you can enter the URLs and credentials of your GitHub Enterprise instance instead of using GitHub.com. This is useful for organizations that have deployed their own GitHub Enterprise instance and want to manage their repositories and workflows in their controlled environment.
